function setround(rnd)
%SETROUND     Switch rounding mode
%
%   setround(rnd)
%
%For  rnd = -1  switch rounding downwards (towards -inf)
%     rnd =  0  switch rounding to nearest
%     rnd =  1  switch rounding upwards (towards inf)
%     rnd =  2  switch rounding towards zero (chop)
%
%For Matlab V5.3+ and following under Windows this is already available
%  by the Matlab-routine 'system_dependent', see below. In this case delete
%  the routine 'setround.dll' (if it is present). INTLAB version 3.1+
%  should do that automatically for you.
%Otherwise, a corresponding 'setround.dll' routine is to be used.
%  For some architectures those can be found on our home page.
%
%It is assumed that the processor is permanently switched into the
%specified rounding mode, i.e. all subsequent operations are performed
%according to this rounding mode. When invoking INTLAB, always
%
%  intvalinit('CheckRounding')
%
%is called to be sure the preceding statement is true. Apparently, there
%are difficulties with DEC Alpha workstations in which op-codes carry
%an individual rounding mode.
